                 <h2>What is Team Tourism?</h2>
                 <p>If you think about it, your current place of work is sort of like an island. Over time your island, much like a real one, has probably evolved its own unique culture and ways of doing things. Team Tourism is for learning about what is beyond your island. It's about going to visit other destinations to see how they do things, and perhaps expand your view of how the world works.</p>
                 <p>If you're in a large organisation, perhaps you want to visit islands in your archipelago. Share a few ideas. Marvel at how you have similar challenges, and perhaps share some useful ideas.</p>
                 <p>Perhaps you really want to push the boat out, and go and visit a very different island, with a totally different approach. Perhaps a different system of government. Immersing yourself in a different way of doing things to come back energised with something to share with your own people.</p>

										<p>Much like a tourist in any foreign destination, a respect for the local culture and an openness and willingness to learn will get you far. Depending on the destination and what you want out of it, a visit might look like one or more of the following:
                    <ul>
                      <li>A cup of coffee and a chat</li>
                      <li>A guided walk through the environment</li>
                      <li>A whiteboard session</li>
                      <li>Joining the team for one of their team meetings (planning, retrospective, etc.)</li>
                      <li>A pair programming session</li>
                      <li>Spending a whole day (or even longer) with the team</li>
                    </ul>
                    Some teams even swap ambassadors for a week to deepen the sharing.</p>

										<p>We recommend requesting a physical Team Tourism Passport to start with, but it's not a requirement. Then you will need to find places that allow tourists to visit them. You could ask around in your own network - we've been surprised at how interested and willing people are to have us around. When you visit a team, ask them to sign your passport as a permanent record and reminder of another stop on your learning journey, and encourage them to start touring as well!</p>

										<p>Just like your normal passport, your team passport is used when you spend time with another team. You get to record your visit in your passport in a similar way you would when you travel to another country with your normal passport. It's not really required to participate in Team Tourism, but it is nice to keep a record of your trips, as a reminder for yourself.</p>

										<p>Along with Team Passports, we can also provide your team with a physical ink stamp, to stamp into the passports of any visitors you get. It's a nice touch, and picking a graphic for your team's stamp can be a great team building/identity reinforcing activity.</p>
