## What is Team Tourism?
Think of your current place of work as an island. It has its own culture and way of doing things. Other 'islands' have very different cultures and their own ways of doing things. Sometimes it's interesting to go and visit a different place, to immerse yourself in a different way of doing things and to come back energised with thing to share with your own people.

Participating in Team Tourism allows you to do exactly that. You can arrange visits with other teams, share and take away new learnings and experiences.
